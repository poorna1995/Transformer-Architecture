## Transformer Architecture - GPT

## Project Overview

### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a simplified version of a GPT-like language model using PyTorch. This implementation includes key components such as multi-head attention, transformer blocks, and a feed-forward neural network. The model is designed to process and generate text based on provided context, demonstrating the principles of transformer architectures and self-attention mechanisms.

### Key Features
- **Text Encoding and Decoding**: Functions to convert raw text to token IDs and back, facilitating easy interaction with the model.
- **Multi-Head Attention Mechanism**: A crucial component that allows the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in a sequence, improving the understanding of context.
- **Transformer Blocks**: Stacked layers of transformer blocks that encapsulate multi-head attention and feed-forward networks, allowing the model to learn complex representations of the input text.
- **Layer Normalization and Dropout**: These techniques help in stabilizing training and preventing overfitting, enhancing model performance.
- **Tokenization**: Utilizes the `tiktoken` library to efficiently tokenize and detokenize text for model processing.

### Components
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - **`GPTDatasetV1`**: A custom dataset class that tokenizes input text and creates input-target pairs using a sliding window technique. This allows the model to learn from overlapping sequences of tokens.
   - **`create_gpt_dataloader`**: A function to generate a data loader for batching and shuffling the dataset during training.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - **`MultiHeadAttention`**: Implements the multi-head attention mechanism, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence.
   - **`TransformerBlock`**: Encapsulates the multi-head attention and feed-forward components, using residual connections and layer normalization.
   - **`GPTModel`**: The main model class that integrates embedding layers, transformer blocks, and the output layer to generate predictions.

3. **Text Generation**:
   - **`generate_next_tokens`**: A function to generate new tokens based on an initial context, demonstrating the model's ability to produce coherent text.
   - **`encode_text_to_tensor`** and **`decode_tensor_to_text`**: Functions for converting between text and token representations, ensuring seamless interaction with the model.
